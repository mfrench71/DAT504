    Timebank is a way for people to share their knowledge and skills with their community and be rewarded for it - with time. For every one hour you volunteer you can claim back the same amount. We call them credits, and you can save them up for those jobs you can’t manage or don’t have the skills or time for. It’s as easy as that.
